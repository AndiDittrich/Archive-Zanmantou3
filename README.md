ARCHIVE | Zanmantou3 - Web-Audio-Video-Player
=============================================

I am very sorry to announce, that the development of Zanmantou3, including the WordPress Plugin is discontinued. 
But in case of the upcomming HTML5 standard and the obvious fact of discontinuing Flash on Linux and mobile devices on the part of Adobe there is no right to exist or better to say necessity for Zanmantou. 

So donâ€™t be worry..i spend some years of development into it.. i am sad too.


But maybe it will be usefull in another way

I've released the full sourcecode, including all build files and themes under the **MIT Style X11 License**. The sources can be compiled using **Adobe Flex 4.5**.
Get inspired; Enjoy it;
